# Workflow Update - Record Type First

## ‚úÖ Changes Complete

The interface workflow has been updated to be more intuitive:

### **NEW WORKFLOW ORDER:**
1. **Record Type Selection** ‚Üí User picks what they want to see (Face Sheets, MED, TRE, OTH)
2. **Facility Selection** ‚Üí User chooses which facility/role (RC, Day, LTC, OP)  
3. **Patient Search** ‚Üí User finds the specific patient
4. **Record Access** ‚Üí User views the patient's records

### **Benefits of This Order:**
- **More Logical**: Users typically know what type of record they need first
- **Better Filtering**: Shows record counts per facility for the selected type
- **Cleaner Flow**: Reduces cognitive load by progressive disclosure
- **Faster Access**: Users can focus on one decision at a time
