# 🏥 Medical Records Integration - Project Complete

## ✅ What Was Built

I've successfully created **two related projects** as requested:

### 1. **Backend Project: `record-transformer`**
- **Node.js service** that transforms HTML medical reports to JSON every 30 minutes
- **Modular parsers** for 4 types of medical records:
  - `Facesheet_data.html` (demographics)
  - `MED_data.html` (medication records) 
  - `TRE_data.html` (treatment records)
  - `OTH_data.html` (orders like labs and therapies)
- **REST API** with endpoints:
  - `GET /residents` → list of residents
  - `GET /residents/:id` → full JSON for one resident
  - `GET /status` → last update timestamp
  - `GET /health` → service health check
- **File watching** system that monitors `/data/raw/` for updated HTML files
- **Automatic processing** every 30 minutes using `chokidar`

### 2. **Frontend Integration: Enhanced DR App**
- **Modern interface** that consumes the backend API instead of parsing HTML in-browser
- **Dynamic loading** based on record type and facility selection
- **Reusable components**:
  - `ResidentProfileCard` → name, age, DOB, facility
  - `MedicationTable` → structured medication display
  - `TreatmentTimeline` → chronological treatment view  
  - `OrderList` → categorized orders (labs, imaging, etc.)
- **Real-time status** showing API connection and last update
- **Offline capability** with sample fallback data
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile

## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

### 1. Start Backend Service
```bash
cd record-transformer
npm install
npm run setup  # Verify setup
npm start      # Starts on port 3001
```

### 2. Start Frontend Interface  
- Open `api-medical-interface.html` in a web browser
- Interface will auto-connect to backend API
- Falls back to sample data if backend unavailable

### 3. Verify Integration
```bash
node verify-setup.js  # Check all files are present
```
